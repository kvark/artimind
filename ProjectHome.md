# Artificial Mind #

The project aims to create an artificial system that converges to something we may call 'mind'. It is in a very early stage of development now, with the initial design constantly changing and evolving. You can try it at your own risk: the author is not responsible for any damages or long-term consequences originating from the working AI.

## Road Map ##
### Stage 0: ###
Dummy world. Simple-minded creatures with sensors and actors. No learning.

### Stage 1: ###
Mind as an adaptive machine. Learning without supervision based on the natural feedback of its actions. No memory.
### Stage 2: ###
Circuit actors and sensors inside the conscience field of the mind. Self-constructed feedback loops inside the adaptive machine.

### Stage 3: ###
Memory implemented. AI is ready to learn and conquer.
